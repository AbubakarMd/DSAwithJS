**Data Structure** is defined as particular way of storing and managing data to use it effectively and efficiently in order to minimize time and space complexities.

**Algorithm** is the well-defined process used to perform any task

<br><br>
### Complexities
> ***Time complexities:*** Amount of time required to execute given code.<br>
> ***Space complexities:*** Space required to successfully execute the given code.

<br>

### Asymptotic Notation
Asymptotic Notation is the measurement of time required in term of input size without execution of code.<br>

>  ***Omega Notation (Ω):*** it describes best case Algorithm <br>
>  ***Theta Notation (θ):*** it describes average case Algorithm<br>
> ***Big-O Notation (Ο):*** it describe the worst case Algorithm<br>

*increasing time complexities:* <br>
O(1)<br>
O(log N)<br>
O(N)<br>
O(N log N)<br>
O(N^2)<br>
O(N!)<br>
